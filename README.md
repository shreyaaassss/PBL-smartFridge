# Smart Kitchen Assistant - Smart Fridge Project

## Overview
The **Smart Kitchen Assistant** is an IoT-based system designed to detect and track food items stored in the refrigerator. It utilizes a microcontroller with a camera to identify items, updates a database when items are added or removed, and provides users with real-time insights into their food inventory. This project aims to reduce food waste and enhance kitchen management efficiency.

## Features
- **Automatic Food Detection**: Uses a camera and image recognition to detect stored food items.
- **Database Integration**: Stores and updates food inventory in a **MongoDB Atlas** database.


## Technologies Used
- **Hardware:** Raspberry Pi (or alternative microcontroller), Camera Module, Sensors
- **Software:** Python, OpenCV (for image recognition), Flask (for backend API)
- **Database:** MongoDB Atlas


## Installation and Setup
### Prerequisites
- Raspberry Pi (or any compatible microcontroller)
- Camera Module
- MongoDB Atlas account
- Python (with required libraries)
